```{r}
samp <- rnbinom(100, size = 2, mu = 10) #taking 100 random values of negative binomial distribution and saving them as "samp"
par(mfrow=c(1,2)) #placing the two following histograms next to each other
hist(samp) #plotting histogram of the 100 random samples of the negative binomial distribution
hist(log(samp+1)) #plotting histogram of logarithm of the sample + 1
```

# What I did:

I drew 100 random values from the negative binomial distribution and saved them as "samp". Then I plotted them in two histograms. One of them with a log scale.

The sample mean is 9.32 and the variance is 45.93697.
